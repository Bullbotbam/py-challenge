Amanda stuck with me through the bitter end which lasted one year.  11 months into the build process it was evident that the builder was not able to complete the job and our hopes of becoming a homeowner were crushed.  Although, I thought becoming a homeowner was not in the cards for me Amanda jumped right in encouraging me to explore other options.

I had been researching for quite some time to find a bank that was customer oriented and the right fit for my mortgage refinance needs. I got an email one day from Mil*****.com and NBKC Bank was listed with many others. I started researching NBKC Bank and found that they were highly rated; especially among Veterans. I was truly pressed to find any negative reviews from anyone. I sent an inquiry and was connected with Ami. We reached out to Ami in early December 2021. I informed her that I was a Veteran and that I wanted to lower my interest rate with a fixed rate in comparison to my current mortgage. I gave Ami as much information as she needed to start the process. Ami advised me to complete the online application and we would go from there. I am very detailed oriented and communication for me is very important. Ami was never lacking in this department. She was very engaging, easy to talk to, understood my needs and requirements and she communicated with us constantly. She was very thorough in advising us in the different programs offered by NBKC Bank and was very thorough in advising us of what documentation to provide. If I ever had any question I would email or call Ami and she was very quick to respond and provide the answers needed. She was with us from the initial application to closing and also offered to us that if we had any additional questions even after closing to not hesitate to reach out to her. This is unmatched professionalism, dedication and exceptional customer service. We are truly grateful that we had the opportunity to work with Ami and I would not hesitate for one moment with recommending her to anyone (family, neighbors, friends or strangers) who are looking for a great Mortgage Loan Officer.

First, when initiating the process, I laid out what my goal was as to how I wanted to pay off the property in 15 years or less. Everything seemed to go as I had planned but numbers (% rate) were slightly different from what was advertised. Nonetheless, the results were close to what I was trying to achieve. Seems to me there may be some manipulation of numbers to actually borrow more then what is needed. Secondly, during the initial conversation and all questions answered, I would suggest to everyone to question the then quoted (guesstimate) pay off of said property to be flexible. Example of that is when  I provided a number as it existed at the time of  the original conversation, and did not reflect the current principle balance because a payment had just been made,  that number never changed. Then, after making two more months payment on the existing loan, the actual payoff figure is nearly $1200.00 dollars less. As it turns out, I'm refinancing and additional twelve hundred more then what I should have. Finally, and I understand (Rocket Mortgage) has guide lines to follow, the providing of two different email addresses became an issue. My wife does not have her own email address. We share the same email address so the other address had to be the business email address she uses while working at home.  We notified the business owner that providing that address was only to allow us to proceed with the refinancing loan process and that it would be removed once we completed that initial filings to get the ball rolling. However, information (which were duplicates) continued for the duration of the refinancing process. It wasn't until we actually signed at closing was it finally removed. Not a good experience with the email address debacle!  \", 'author': 'Patrick                                                                        from Murrells Inlet,  SC', 'rating': '(3 of 5)stars', 'type': 'Refinance', 'date': 'Reviewed in April 2021'}\n",

I have been a very happy Capital One customer for over 17 years now. I have financed at least 3 vehicles with them. Currently have 2 auto loans with them and another auto loan with another company. But I want to refinance that Beauty with Capital One. I have had financing through the manufacture of the vehicles before and they were good too. But no company is as great as Capital One. Then again I never pay minimum payments on cards. Prefer to pay them in full as much as possible. I also never pay minimum payments on the auto loans. You save on interest and it puts you ahead. So for those of you who complain maybe you should pay extra and then you will eventually be months ahead on your car payments. Then if something comes up you don’t have to make a payment for a month or however many u are paid through. Just saying if your good to Capital One they will be good to you in return. I just had to say something because Capital One is an awesome company. They are even willing to give people second chances. Just be kind to others and in return you will receive the same. Writing bad things about a company that expects you to actually pay your bills on time is just flat out unfair. They gave you a loan when you wanted a new car and now you are bad mouthing them. Not cool!! If they gave everyone a free ride they would be out of business. You would probably have to have owned or own a business to understand I suppose.

The first time they were easy to deal with and had no problems helping me out when I needed to defer a payment.  I decided to finance with them again when I bought a car 3 years ago.  I recently called and asked for a deferment due to Covid and was told they could not help me.  I was told the only thing they could offer me was to make a portion of the payment and then pay the rest before my next note was due. They ask so many demeaning questions about my income and why I needed the deferment.  That is not any of their business. I have always made my payments and never have had a repossession.  About 6 months ago I purchased a brand new 2020 Dodge Ram 1500 and financed it through another company.  They have been amazing. They gave me a deferment without all the demeaning questions.  I will most certainly finance with them from this point forward.  As far as Capital One Auto Finance I will NEVER finance with them again and will tell everyone I know to steer clear of them at any cost.  They are the worst auto finance company around.

The process started out great and I will say the rate I got was a good rate.\\r\\nHowever the process leading up to closing which was delayed several times was painful and I ended up losing approximately $1000 in credit due to me.  My realtor had notified MB on two separate occasions at least one to two months from closing that I was likely going to end up with more credits due back to me at closing than I could take at closing however with a VA loan, there are creative ways you can use excess credits so you don\\'t lose them.\\r\\nI was worried that could happen so I repeatedly asked leading up to closing if I could review the financial documents to ensure I was getting all the credits I was entitled to and several times my requests were ignored.  When I did finally get a chance to review a document, it was in error but led me to believe that most of the credits were accounted for.  I queried Jim Brabec on this issue and other issues and never got responses.  Lo and behold when I show up to closing (which had been delayed), the amount I was expecting due back to me at closing was reduced by approximately $1300.  When I questioned them, they said there was nothing that could be done other than delay closing yet again which would have impacted me and the sellers and caused the sellers to have to pay financial penalties.  So the very one thing I was worried about and my realtor brought to their attention TWICE early on, bit me in the butt because I relied on MB to be a professional bank.\\r\\nNever have they apologized and accepted responsibility for their errors.  I have raised this issue up to the Senior VP level who basically has blown me off.  I am sure he looked into my matter, but the phone discussions were of the tone that, \"Sorry nothing can be done, you\\'re outta luck.  We offered you a chance to delay closing and get the excess credits, but you turned it down\".

Agents were extremely busy juggling multiple deals and would re-ask for the same documents multiple times over which wasted much time. Communication was good, but you have to stay on top of them to move the process along, which was difficult. Underwriter was extremely tedious to a point that they acted like they were looking for an excuse to kill our deal even with 800  credit scores and substantial savings. Once they pulled their commitment, we even offered to put a significantly larger downpayment and even pay a higher interest rate to save the deal, but it did us no good. Citizens Bank completely kicked us to the curb last minute when the Covid virus struck us, and now we are in litigation with the seller for a missed closing deadline. We are now paying litigation legal fees that would equal months worth of mortgage payments. Please AVOID using Citizens Bank for your mortgage and home financing needs at all costs. Biggest mistake of our lives was to work with Citizens Bank based on a personal relationship we had with their agent from knowing them for years.

I have a checking account that I use profusely for Work direct deposit and payment of all bills. I had issues before with their predatory overdraft fees that are out of control and after complaining I got a letter from the office of the Chairman that did nothing for me. But, this is another matter.I also have a Home Equity Line of Credit. I had some financial difficulties so I got behind two payments. Last week, they sent me a foreclosure package about options that I have to keep my house, etc. Now that I got back on my feet I was ready to resume payments so I called the number they have on the package to discuss either lump sum payment or two payment installments. When I dialed the number they have on the letter, it asked to dial the extension number (no extension was given on the letter) or zero for the operator. I dialed zero but a recorder came up asking to leave a message. I did leave an urgent message to call me back immediately since I was obviously anxious about losing my house. That was a week ago. To this writing the HELOC did not even contact me once. I guess they are waiting to pass the time so they can foreclose on the house, and this is apparently not an urgent and important matter to Citizens Bank. Yesterday, 03/06/2020 on Friday night, I went to the branch in Dearborn Heights, MI. The Personal Banker was nice and she called the same number on the letter and had the same experienced I faced. She used her internal number and they gave her a Consumer Finance Line 800*********. However, this was Collections for vehicles and personal loans. They told her that Equity department was closed (it was after 5:00 P.M.) now and they will be open Saturday from 8:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M. On the next day Saturday, I called at 9:30 A.M. Again, it was the Collections Department for Vehicle loans and personal loans. The person who answered said I called the wrong number (!) but Equity Collections is closed anyways on Saturday and they will open from Monday to Friday. This is contradictory, chaotic, and non-professional. I am wasting and losing precious time on what? not being able to call and talk to someone who is threatening to foreclose on my house because of a stupid Equity Line?  I hung up and dialed the so-called Office of the Chairman trying to talk to his secretary about this quagmire but, of course, she was not available until Monday. Now, I have to overcome my anxiety over the weekend. It's time to get rid of this bank and I hope all can see the shoddy and bad service I experienced. For what I faced this Bank deserves less than one star.  \", 'author': 'Khalil                                                                        from Dearborn,  MI', 'rating': '(1 of 5)stars', 'type': 'Home Equity Loan or Line of Credit', 'date': 'Reviewed in March 2020'}\n",
